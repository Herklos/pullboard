const ALL_HELP = `pullboard ${VERSION}: the local-first work board for teams of coding agents.
Nothing ships until a second agent verifies it.

Set up
  pullboard tour                        see it work: a reject and its rework, scripted, in thirty seconds
  pullboard init [--model <name>] [--blueprint <name or file>]... [--no-permissions] [--yes] [--verbose]  short setup summary; --verbose shows recipes; --yes commits only setup's own files with your Git identity
  pullboard worktree <lane> --model <name> [--route light] [--family <name>]   make and join a worktree for a new agent
                                        pullboard.json worktrees: inside or beside; init defaults to inside
  pullboard join <lane> --model <name> [--route light] [--family <name>]       register this worktree as an agent
                                        A model is required (or set PULLBOARD_MODEL); family is a separate declaration
  pullboard join coordinator --model <name>                                 declare the main checkout's coordinator model
                                        pullboard.json agents.names: suffix (default) or prefix
  pullboard whoami | lanes | status     who you are, the lanes, the board at a glance
  pullboard agents                      each agent with its seats and helpers, and what each holds
  pullboard lane add <name> --owns <path>[,<path>]   add a lane that owns those folders to pullboard.json
                                        refuses a lane name or a path that is already owned, naming the owner
  pullboard takeover                   rebind this checkout when the same agent starts a new session
                                        in a linked main checkout it also takes the board's coordinator here
  pullboard resources                  local resource holders and their FIFO queues
  pullboard settings [gateSlots <n> | browserSlots <n>]  view or set machine capacity (gate default 2; browser default 1)
                                        browser-free check slots are opt-in: gate.browserFreeChecks in ~/.pullboard/settings.json (default false)
                                        a test file takes a browser slot only if it launches Chrome: gate.browserByLaunch (default false)
                                        reviews-first queue order is opt-in: gate.queue.reviewsFirst (default false), gate.queue.agingMinutes (default 30)
                                        release priority is opt-in: gate.queue.currentReleaseFirst (default false), within each board's otherwise-tied positions
                                        memory hold is opt-in: gate.memoryFloorMB in ~/.pullboard/settings.json holds the queue under that many MB free or critical pressure (default off)
                                        short slots for runs that name their test files are opt-in: pullboard settings gate.shortSlots <n> (default 0)
  pullboard runner add <ssh-host> --slots <n> --browser <n> [--node <remote-path>] [--root <remote-path>]
                                        register SSH test capacity; no runner sign-in; root defaults to ~/.pullboard-runner
  pullboard view [--project] [--port N] [--no-open]  every project on this machine in your browser; default http://127.0.0.1:${DEFAULT_VIEW_PORT}
                                        items, shouts, doctrine, agents and activity; --port 0 chooses a free port
                                        --project limits this view to the registered project for this repository
                                        add items, shout and hold lanes from it
  pullboard view --export <dir>         a read-only snapshot with event replay, for any static host
  pullboard serve [--port N]           local API v1: boards, state, moves, requests and live events,
                                        behind the session secret in its printed address
  pullboard mcp                        MCP tools over stdio for this worktree's agent, started by its MCP client:
                                        board status, show, shout and capture an idea; a person's move is refused
  pullboard relay [status|on|off|pair|join <code>] [--url <address>]  link, inspect or unlink this board's sealed relay
                                        on signs in through GitHub; the address defaults to https://app.pullboard.dev
                                        pair prints a one-use machine code; join stores it in another clone
  pullboard relay pair --new-browser    sign in and pair one more browser; existing browsers stay paired
  pullboard relay on --all [--url <address>]  link every registered project after one sign-in; pair the phone once
                                        keep this command open until pairing finishes; later projects link on registration
  pullboard relay devices [--verbose]   paired phones and joined computers by name, with paired date, last seen and boards
                                        --verbose adds each id and phone key fingerprint
  pullboard relay revoke <device>       stop future key delivery; already received keys remain known
                                        approve on another paired phone, or sign in again with GitHub
  pullboard relay tokens                list this board's agent token ids, agents and expiry, never credentials
  pullboard relay revoke <token-id>     revoke one token from that list; other agents keep working
  pullboard relay recover --skip <sequence>  person-only recovery of one blocked next relay position
  pullboard resume                      where you are: your claim, branch, uncommitted work, what came back,
                                        unread shouts, what to do next; run it to start any session
  pullboard hooks                       reinstall the git hooks (e.g. after a fresh clone)

Work
  pullboard add <lane> <title> [--criterion "..."] [--specs G1.2,K3] [--after 3,4] [--parent <id>]
                [--brief "..." | --brief-file <file>] [--route light|mid]
                                        --after: claiming waits until those items are verified
                                        --brief: what a cold agent needs; --route light: any model can build it
                [--check "<command>"] [--wait]   the command that proves it; --wait waits for its main baseline
                                        with --criterion and a brief, --check is needed below strong
  pullboard edit <id> [--brief "..." | --brief-file <file>] [--route light|mid|strong] [--criterion "..."] [--check "..."]
                [--wait]                wait for a new check's baseline; otherwise it runs in the background
                [--reason "what the old bar got wrong"]   needed to change the criterion or check of an item
                                        that was ever claimed; show and stats list each correction
  pullboard escalate <id> --note "what was tried and how it failed"   hand it one tier up
  pullboard run --agent "<command>" [--attempts 3] [--minutes 15] [--items N] [--wait M]
                                        build routed items unattended in this worktree: the agent command reads
                                        the context pack at $PULLBOARD_PACK (and $PULLBOARD_CHECK, $PULLBOARD_ITEM,
                                        $PULLBOARD_ATTEMPT, $PULLBOARD_TIER); green work is submitted, red escalated
                [--agent-light "..."] [--agent-mid "..."] [--agent-strong "..."]   a command per tier
  pullboard list [lane] [--all] [--route light|mid|strong]   open and active items; --all adds closed ones
  pullboard queue                       the work queue in pull order: releases, then route, lane, holder and waits
  pullboard roadmap                     ordered milestones, N/M landed, targets, and each item as landed,
                                        accepted or its status
  pullboard milestone add <name> [--note ...] [--items 1,2,3]   create a milestone and optionally add items
  pullboard milestone items <name> --add|--remove ids          append or remove item references
  pullboard milestone order <name> <ids>                       rank these items within their milestone (agents)
  pullboard milestone move <name> --before <other>             reorder a milestone
  pullboard milestone edit <name> [--name <new>] [--note <text>] [--target <date and time>|none]
                                        rename, update a note, or set the target a milestone ships by
  pullboard milestone ship <name> [--next <name>]              record it shipped at main's commit and move
                                        its unlanded items into the next milestone (or --next)
  pullboard milestone remove <name>                            remove a milestone without changing its items
  pullboard doctor                     check board integrity without changing it
  pullboard health                     every stuck item: why, since when, the next step and who takes it
  pullboard sentinel propose <name> --check "<command>" --every 10m|hourly|daily --owner <seat or lane> [--directory <path>] [--timeout <milliseconds>] [--next "<step>"]
                                        propose an exact board watch; only the person may approve it
  pullboard sentinel approve <name>     person: approve this command, directory and schedule
  pullboard sentinel decline <name> --reason "<why>"   person: prevent future runs
  pullboard sentinels                   approvals, owners and the last result; does not run checks
  pullboard loop declare <name> --every 10m --owner <seat or lane>   coordinator: declare a recurring job's cadence
  pullboard loop ran <name>             record that a recurring job just ran; health flags one silent for 1.5 cadences
  pullboard loop                        list the recurring jobs and their last runs
                                        reads the board and changes nothing; exits 1 when something is stuck
                                        pullboard.json health.stuck (default 1h), health.holds (1d), health.release (1d)
  pullboard skills --update            refresh unchanged Claude Code skills from shipped versions
  pullboard show <id> [--history]       an item, the criterion frozen at claim, its verdicts: the latest in full,
                                        earlier ones as one line; --history prints every note in full
  pullboard fact <id> <kind> <text> [--supersedes <fact-id>] [--ref path:lines@full-sha] [--implies <ids>]
                                        append an observation or a holder/coordinator judgement to its thread
                                        --implies 12,13: each named item gets a fact citing this decision,
                                        and is told again when the decision is superseded
                                        the person adds --cause <key> --never-again --as person: rigor lists it at once
  pullboard why <id>                    the decisions that imply an item, newest first, and what superseded them
  pullboard next [--wait <minutes>]     offer an eligible review when reviews pile up, otherwise claim work
  pullboard next --build                claim a build explicitly, recording a skipped review offer
  pullboard next --verify               reserve the next submitted item you can check;
  pullboard next --verify <id>          reserve that submitted item instead
                                        in the main checkout, verifying needs --as coordinator
  pullboard check [id] [--yes]          show and run your item's check; --yes confirms a check set by someone else
                                        the command and its author print first; the project gate is pullboard gate
  pullboard check accept <id>           the person accepts an item's check that already passes on main, as it reads now;
                                        with checks.provesNothing "hold", claim and submit refuse that item until then
  pullboard claim <id>                  take or renew a lease; the first claim freezes the criterion
  pullboard release <id> [--note "why"]  hand it back; a review release needs a one-line reason
  pullboard submit <id>                 needs a clean tree, item check and affected tests green at HEAD (alias: done)
                                        --infra "<why>": required when the change edits an existing test or gate file; the reviewer reads it in show
  pullboard verify <id> accept --note "what you broke or which edge you tried, and what happened"
  pullboard verify <id> reject --reason TEST_FAILURE --note "what failed" [--cause <key>]
                                        a cause is test:<file>::<title>, refusal:<CODE>, row:<id> or doctrine:<id>
                                        a verdict takes --implies <ids>; a later verdict on the item supersedes it
                                        any --note can be --note-file <file>, which keeps quotes, $ and backticks intact
  pullboard shout <lane|agent|person|all> <text>  pullboard inbox
  pullboard shout [<to>] <text> --decision       ask for a decision; defaults to your coordinator or the person
  pullboard shout <to> <text> --evidence attempt|receipt --outcome <word> --item <id> --commit <rev>
  pullboard answer <shout-id> <text> [--as person] [--implies <ids>] [--supersedes <answer-id>]
                                        answer your decision; person mode is main-checkout only
                                        --supersedes tells the items an earlier answer implied; only the person
                                        supersedes the person's answer
  pullboard pass <shout-id> <note>                coordinator passes a decision to the person
  pullboard decisions [--as person]               shouts waiting for you; main checkout defaults to coordinator
  pullboard watch [--to <agent|lane|all>] [--kinds <kinds>] [--item <id>] [--since <sequence>] [--json]
                [--work <lane>] [--review-wait <minutes>]
                                        follow the board's live events, one line each as it happens, with or without the view
                                        --work also says when an item there becomes claimable, a review waits longer than
                                        --review-wait minutes (default 20), or main moves; Ctrl-C stops it
  pullboard export                              print the whole board as versioned JSON
  pullboard digest [--out <file>] [--watch]     a short Markdown briefing of this board for a person or a chat assistant;
                                        secrets redacted; --out replaces a file, --watch rewrites it after every move
  pullboard import <file>                       restore a versioned export into an empty board

Coordinator
  pullboard sweep --run "<checker>" --check "<checker on {file}>" [--route light] [--max 20] [--dry-run]
                                        file one item per file a linter, type checker or test reporter flags
  pullboard land [--max N] [--dry-run] [--adopt]  gate and push a durable batch of verified items
  pullboard land --waive <test> --until <date> --reason \"why\"  the person records an expiring test waiver
  pullboard publish                     coordinator: run the whole suite on the trunk head; push it only when every test passes
  pullboard merged <id> <commit>        record where verified work landed
  pullboard withdraw <id> <reason>      drop an item nobody should build
  pullboard refreeze <id>               adopt a corrected criterion or changed spec rows
  pullboard reopen <id> --note "why" [--cause <key>]   return a submission for criterion correction without a verdict
  pullboard reopen <id> --conflict <file> [--conflict <file>]
                                        return accepted work that conflicts with the trunk for a main merge
  pullboard hold <lane> --reason "..."   pause a lane: next there claims nothing and names the reason
  pullboard hold <id> "reason"          hold one item so next skips it
  pullboard hold <lane|id> --off        lift a lane or item hold

Receipts
  pullboard stats [--since <date>]      proof numbers from the event log; --json for sites and tools
                                        stage averages/medians count ends inside the inclusive UTC window;
                                        build: first claim to final submit (including rework);
                                        review wait: final submit to the closing review reservation;
                                        released/expired reservations remain wait, not review;
                                        review: closing reservation to verdict; merge wait: accept to first merge
                                        unfinished stages are omitted; missing legacy reservations are unmeasured
                                        JSON flow.asOf records one observation clock; oldest.since records its origin;
                                        ageMinutes = (asOf - since) / 60000 for every queue age
                                        queues include all current work, even added before --since;
                                        open age restarts on add, reopen, reject, release or claim lapse;
                                        claimed age starts at claim (not renewal), submitted at final submit,
                                        accepted-not-merged at accept; oldest ties use the lower item id
                                        daily additions and first merges use UTC dates; repeated merge receipts count once
                                        active agents moved in the last 60 minutes (inclusive), by role and lane;
                                        role is latest role-bearing move, falling back to earlier history or unknown:
                                        claim/submit/build release = builder; reserve/verdict/review release = verifier;
                                        the coordinator is coordinator; shouts and joins never imply a role
                                        bottleneck: largest summed stage share over fully measured first-merge cycles;
                                        ties: build, review wait, review, merge wait; print fully measured/total cycles;
                                        fewer than half fully measured means low confidence; no measured cycles means no action
                                        one action, first matching rule:
                                        review wait + fewer than 1 verifier per 4 active builders: add a verifier
                                        review wait otherwise: review the oldest submission first (#N)
                                        build + more than 30% sent back: tighten criteria or briefs: N of M submissions were sent back
                                        build otherwise: add a builder in the lane with most open items (lane-name tie)
                                        review: reviews are slow (median X min): check how long the frozen checks take
                                        merge wait: land the accepted items: #A, #B
                                        when that queue is empty, the action says none waiting or waits for open work
  pullboard ledger                      markdown: what was built, by whom, verified by whom
  pullboard log [id]                    every move, in order
  pullboard flakes                      recorded failures, their first and last sightings, counts and repair status
  pullboard flakes rerun on|off          coordinator: opt into one diagnostic pair per failed test; off by default
  pullboard flakes quarantine on|off     coordinator: let a proven flake stop blocking landings until its repair item is verified; off by default
                                        commit pullboard.json to apply; a passing diagnostic never turns the original red green
  pullboard rigor                       failure causes that repeated: on 2 items, or 1 item at 2 commits;
                                        each with its items and whether it reads as work, product or both
  pullboard rigor --draft-splits        coordinator on main: draft review-gated split proposals for files colliding on 2 items in 14 days; only the person approves

                                        --red is a noticed failure commit; prove its check red, then green at --green
                                        draft Doctrine (work), spec (product) or both; only the person approves
                                        test: causes need literal node --test <file> and the named test actually failing, then passing

Spec
  pullboard spec --json                 parsed SPEC.md and doctrine rows as JSON
  pullboard forget <path>               remove a repo from this machine's project list
  pullboard spec check                  lint SPEC.md and the doctrine (house rules for agentic development)
  pullboard spec view [--out file]      the spec, open questions, sign-offs and doctrine as one page
  pullboard spec show <id> | unmet [--must] | signoff <ids> [--by <principal>]
                                        signoff: --note "what was checked" stays with the receipt
  pullboard spec draft <text> [--section <letter>] [--aim] [--gate "<gate>"]  any agent appends a draft row; never approves it
                [--doctrine --source "<shout id or chat, date>"]  the coordinator proposes a sourced doctrine ruling
                                        --section chooses the section prefix; defaults to G, or DR with --doctrine
                                        Defaults to must and gate review.
  pullboard blueprint add <name or file> [--blueprint <name or file>]...  add a blueprint's rules and questions as drafts, and its starter items
                                        bundled: web-app; nothing is approved, and a repeat adds nothing
                                        several land in order: one product, one architecture, any practice; a shared rule is drafted once
  pullboard blueprint fit <name or file> <row id or #item> keep|adapt|drop|answer [--text "..."] [--reason "why"]  propose this repo's fit; nothing applies yet
  pullboard spec fit [approve <batch>] | fit edit <row id or #item> keep|adapt|drop|answer [--text "..."] [--reason "why"]  the person's fit batch
  pullboard blueprint save [file] [--name <name>] [--title "<title>"]  write approved rules and answered questions as a blueprint
                                        never items, notes, paths, emails or names; file defaults to <project>.blueprint.json
  pullboard blueprint starters <name or file>  list a blueprint's starter items and whether each is filed
                                        a filed starter shows its item id and status; add links each starter it files with a note fact
  pullboard spec signers add [--key <path>] [--by <principal>]  opt into SSH-signed sign-offs
                                        principal defaults to Git user.email; --by overrides it
  pullboard spec approve <ids> | decline <ids> --reason "why"  the person's exact-row decision
                                        approve <id> --text "new wording" approves an exact rewrite
  pullboard spec answer <id> "<choice or text>"  the person's answer to a pending question
                                        a listed choice, or their own words added as the last choice
  pullboard spec apply                  coordinator applies recorded row decisions to the files
  pullboard doctrine check              each doctrine rule's check: its count, its committed count, whether it holds
                                        a rule row adds | gate: check <command> | count: N, and | files: <paths> to narrow it
                                        the command prints one line per problem and exits 0 or 1; anything else cannot count
                                        submit refuses a touched rule whose count rises; runs: nightly skips submit, mode: watch only counts

Role guides
  pullboard prompt decompose|plan|signoff|review|verify   how to do each role; Claude Code gets them as skills

Gate and hooks
  pullboard gate [--landing]            run the configured gate; prioritize a trunk landing in the machine queue
  pullboard gate set "<command>"         record the project gate in the main checkout; commit it before running the gate
  pullboard hook pre-commit|pre-merge-commit|commit-msg|pre-push   git runs these
