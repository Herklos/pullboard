/**
 * Blueprint fit: after a blueprint lands, a seat proposes how each drafted row, question and
 * starter item fits this repo, and the person approves every proposal as one batch [S1,E3].
 *
 * A proposal is keep, adapt (with the new text), drop (with a reason) or, for a question the repo
 * already settles, answer (with one of its choices). Proposals wait in one file in the git common
 * dir, beside the board, so every worktree of this clone records into the same batch and the
 * person sees them all from the main checkout. Nothing in SPEC.md or on the board changes until
 * the person approves: then each row proposal becomes the person's own row decision (the usual
 * pending apply), each starter adaptation becomes the item's new criterion and each starter drop
 * withdraws it, and every one keeps its reason and its blueprint source.
 *
 * The proposer is the seat's own identity, read by the caller from the board, and the seat's agent
 * session digest; no flag sets either. Any local process can still edit the file, so a proposal is
 * an unverified draft and is always shown as one, with its recorder named as recorded, never as
 * authenticated. The durable record is the person's batch approval on the board. Approval is the
 * person's alone: it refuses an agent session that recorded any proposal in the batch, then every
 * agent shell, remote shell and worktree, then any difference from what the person last read.
 *
 * The person's reading is bound by the person's own hand, not by a file: every listing prints a
 * batch code, a digest of each proposal's id, target and content, and approve takes that code as
 * its argument. The reading file beside the batch only lets a refusal name what differs; approve
 * first checks that the stored reading still hashes to the code the person typed, so a forged or
 * rewritten reading is refused, and only then compares it with the batch, entry by entry: a
 * proposal read but now missing, new since the reading, or changed is refused by name. Like a
 * person's row decision, which is trusted because the person's own channel records it, the
 * approval rests on input only the person gives; anything an agent can write is only a draft.
