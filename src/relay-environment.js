/**
 * A CI or cloud session's board, from its environment alone [E18]. A session that cannot pair holds an agent token
 * (PULLBOARD_RELAY_TOKEN) and the board key (PULLBOARD_RELAY_KEY), and optionally the relay address
 * (PULLBOARD_RELAY_URL). On its first command in a clone with no relay link, the relay names the token's board and
 * agent; the session reads that board's sealed snapshot with the key and then works as that agent. The link it saves
 * holds neither the token nor the key, so nothing secret lands on disk, and its scope is the token's one board.
