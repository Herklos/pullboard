/**
 * Every shape of opening a board through pullboard.dev, in real Chromium and real WebKit [H5,H17,N26].
 *
 * Each cell is one of: where the browser is (the computer with the boards, its view running or not; another
 * computer; a phone) x the account (signed out, signed in) x this browser (paired, not paired, revoked) x the
 * boards (none linked, excluded, healthy, over the size limit, waiting for a phone approval, mixed) x what the
 * browser has stored (fresh, a stale pairing link, a stale board key). Each runs with the real CLI, a real local
 * relay, a real `pullboard view` and real browsers, and must show the board within 3 s, or name its exact blocker
 * and the one step that clears it, never a step the person already took. A cell that fails is a filed defect,
 * listed in KNOWN_DEFECTS with its item; the matrix fails on any other failing cell, and on a listed cell that now
 * passes, so the list stays true. Every cell and the screen it must reach:
