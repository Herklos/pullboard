/**
 * Rigor check: no source or test file over 1500 lines [D1,C7].
 *
 * A source or test file is any file ending .js, .mjs, .cjs or .css under the root (see scan.js for
 * the walk and what it skips). Its length is its count of lines as an editor numbers them: one per
 * newline, plus one for a last line without a newline.
 *
 * A file over the cap prints one problem per started 100 lines over it: a file of 1501 to 1600
 * lines prints one, 1601 to 1700 two, and so on. Each problem names its block of lines, as
 * `src/cli.js:1601: lines 1601-1700 are over the 1500-line cap`. Why per block: a doctrine count
 * only falls, and one line per file would let an over-cap file grow forever without the count
 * moving. With one per block, adding 100 lines to an over-cap file raises the count by one.
