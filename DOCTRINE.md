# Practice

How pullboard itself is built: the house rules, as rows. SPEC.md says what to build; this file says how. A row whose gate names a check fails the build when broken; a row gated by review guides agents and reviewers.

Statuses: approved = in force · draft = proposed · wont = considered and declined, id kept · retired = dropped, id kept. Ids are permanent: never delete or renumber a row. Tiers: must · aim.

## W · Writing
- W1 [approved, must] Numbers over adjectives. No hedges, no filler. | gate: review
- W2 [approved, must] Headers: type(scope): subject [ids], 72 characters, no emojis. A body only for a non-obvious why, three sentences at most. | gate: commit-msg hook, review
- W3 [approved, must] Spec ids go in commits, code headers and test names, never in words meant for people. | gate: review
- W4 [approved, must] A refusal names its rule as a code and says the next step. | gate: review
- W5 [draft, must] Tracked files and commit bodies never quote the owner or report what they said, chose or wanted, and never name private infrastructure: machine names, hostnames, LAN addresses or home paths. A commit is a subject line, then at most `Pullboard-Item: #N`. | gate: review

## C · Code
- C1 [approved, must] Plain JavaScript ES modules; no build step. | gate: package test
- C2 [approved, must] Zero runtime dependencies: every import is a node: built-in or a file in this repo. | gate: test/package.test.js
- C3 [approved, must] Every function has a JSDoc block: what it does, then why when that is not obvious. | gate: review
- C4 [approved, must] Refusals throw Refused(code, message); nothing else exits the process except the bin. | gate: review
- C5 [approved, must] Text from files or users is escaped before it reaches a page. | gate: test/view.test.js
- C6 [draft, aim] Functions under 60 lines and files under 1,000. | gate: review
- C9 [approved, must] Source and test files stay under 1500 lines; existing excess can only fall. Why: bounded files keep changes and reviews manageable. | gate: check node bin/checks/file-size.js | count: 54
- C8 [approved, must] No bare empty catch hides a failure; existing cases can only fall. Why: failures need handling or an explicit reason to ignore them. | gate: check node bin/checks/empty-catch.js | count: 13
- C10 [draft, must] No silent catch or fallback: each one logs a specific line that names its subject. Rigor names each catch clause and .catch handler a change adds to a source file that neither throws nor writes a line; a fallback written with a default operator is review. | gate: check node bin/pullboard.js rigor quality --rule silent-catch | count: 0 | source: rigor-quality:silent-catch
- C11 [draft, must] A file over the 1500-line cap, or a change that grows code past its 400-line budget, is named. Rigor names each changed source file that ends over 1500 lines and grew, and a change whose non-test code grows by more than 400 lines net, or the board's rigor.budget setting, at the file that grew most. | gate: check node bin/pullboard.js rigor quality --rule size-budget | count: 0 | source: rigor-quality:size-budget

## T · Tests
- T1 [approved, must] Tests use node:test against real git repos and a real SQLite file, not mocks. | gate: review
- T2 [approved, must] Every test name cites the spec rows it proves. | gate: review
- T3 [approved, must] The suite passes on Node 22, 24 and 26 before a release. | gate: release check
- T4 [draft, must] A check that guards a rule is shown failing on a broken copy before anyone trusts it. | gate: review
- T5 [approved, must] Every test name cites the spec rows it proves; existing omissions can only fall. Why: a passing test must name the requirement it checks. | gate: check node bin/checks/test-names.js | count: 15
- T6 [approved, must] Tests declare the source files they read; existing omissions can only fall. Why: affected-test selection must see those dependencies. | gate: check node bin/checks/test-inputs.js | count: 19
- T7 [draft, must] A fix ships with a test that reproduces the original failure. Rigor names each fix commit that changes no test file, at the first line it changes; whether the test reproduces the failure is the root-cause-control rule. | gate: check node bin/pullboard.js rigor quality --rule fix-test | count: 0 | source: rigor-quality:fix-test
- T8 [draft, must] A new gate or check has a test that fails closed when it has no data. Rigor names a new file under checks/ or gates/, or named *-check or *-gate, that no test changed in the same change names; whether that test feeds it no data and expects a refusal is review, since no command can read what a test asserts. | gate: check node bin/pullboard.js rigor quality --rule fails-closed | count: 0 | source: rigor-quality:fails-closed
- T9 [draft, must] A guard test fails when the guard is deleted. Rigor turns each throw a change adds to a source file into a no-op, one at a time, and runs the test files the change touches; a guard they still pass without is named. | gate: check node bin/pullboard.js rigor quality --rule guard-mutation | count: 0 | source: rigor-quality:guard-mutation
- T10 [draft, must] A root cause is proven by a control that would have come out differently before the fix lands. Rigor runs each fix commit's changed test files on the fix's parent, where they must fail, and at the fix, where they must pass; a cause argued only in prose is review. | gate: check node bin/pullboard.js rigor quality --rule root-cause-control | count: 0 | source: rigor-quality:root-cause-control

## G · Git and the gate
- G1 [approved, must] `npm run gate` (spec check and tests) passes before every push. | gate: pre-push hook
- G2 [approved, must] Never bypass a hook. Never rewrite the main line, except to remove a secret. | gate: review
- G3 [approved, must] This repo's hooks run the source in this checkout. | gate: .githooks

## S · Security
- S1 [approved, must] No secrets and no env files in git; test fixtures build fake secrets at run time. | gate: pre-commit secret scan
- S2 [approved, must] The board never stores source code, only ids, commits and digests. | gate: review
