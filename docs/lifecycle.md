# The item lifecycle

Generated from src/machine.js by `pullboard lifecycle`. Do not edit it by hand: change the declaration, then run `pullboard lifecycle > docs/lifecycle.md`.

An item starts open. Its final states, withdrawn, cannot be left. Every move into a guarded state passes the same transition guards, whatever command gets there. The board file itself refuses any move not declared here.

## Frozen check policy

The coordinator may set `check.install` and `check.timeout` in committed `pullboard.json`; the defaults are no install command and `5m`. Accept runs the configured install and the frozen item check in a private clone, under one timeout budget. It reuses the verifier’s npm cache when available. Install commands that need network downloads conflict with P2 (offline); configure an offline install or make its needed packages available in the cache.

Private commands drain their output through pipes, retaining a bounded 8 MiB capture of its beginning and end. Failed or unverifiable checks stream the complete log through secret scanning into an owner-readable artifact; lines over 64 KiB of UTF-8 data are replaced with a safe-scan marker. Output beyond the capture cap does not fail a successful command, and dependency files and build artifacts have no capture-size limit. A timeout kills the command's process group. An unverified check names how to restore the environment and retry; a failing check names rejection or builder rework as the next step.

## States

| State | Means | Fields it needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| open | waiting for a builder; claimable once what it waits on is verified | none |
| claimed | an agent holds it under a lease, its criterion frozen | item_owner, item_lease_until, item_frozen_digest |
| submitted | built and gated green at a pinned commit, waiting for another agent | item_built_by, item_commit, item_frozen_digest |
| verified | another agent accepted it at the submitted commit | item_verified_by, item_commit |
| withdrawn (final) | nobody should build it; the reason stays on it | item_withdrawn_reason |

## Moves

Each move checks its guards in this order and refuses with the first one that does not hold; result-path refusals are listed separately.

| SELF_VERIFY | the caller did not build it, and its agent session did not build or submit it under any seat; on a linked board, at engine 48 or newer, the caller was enrolled through the relay by a line of creating seats from the coordinator that includes neither the builder nor a machine join | another agent verifies it: pullboard next --verify |
| VERIFIER_STANDING | the caller did not build it, and its agent session did not build or submit it under any seat; on a linked board, at engine 48 or newer, the caller was enrolled through the relay by a line of creating seats from the coordinator that includes neither the builder nor a machine join | the coordinator makes an independent verifier from the main checkout: pullboard worktree <lane> --model "<model name>" |
| SELF_SESSION_VERIFY | the caller did not build it, and its agent session did not build or submit it under any seat; on a linked board, at engine 48 or newer, the caller was enrolled through the relay by a line of creating seats from the coordinator that includes neither the builder nor a machine join | ask another agent session to verify it: pullboard next --verify from that session's own worktree |
| COORDINATOR_VERIFIES | the repo's verify policy lets the caller verify this lane's work | the coordinator verifies it |

| SUBMISSION_PROOF | recorded test selection names literal project files and its full-fallback policy, engine 38 or later; absent legacy selection remains unknown | rerun submit with the current CLI |
| LANDING_FAILURE_REQUIRED | a verified item note names the failing test and landing merge commit, unless the reopen names a trunk conflict | cite the recorded batch, or name the test and merge commit in a manual note; work that only conflicts with the trunk reopens with --conflict <file> for each conflicting file |
| NOT_CONFLICTING | the accepted commit no longer merges onto the trunk, and every named file is one that conflicts, only for reopen --conflict by the coordinator on accepted, unmerged work | merge it, or reopen after a red landing with --note "<test file>: <test name>; merge commit <sha>" |
| CONFLICT_FILES | the accepted commit no longer merges onto the trunk, and every named file is one that conflicts, only for reopen --conflict by the coordinator on accepted, unmerged work | name only files Git reports as conflicting with the trunk |

| ENGINE_VERSION | a trunk conflict reopens an accepted item, names its files and the full trunk commit, and replays only under engine 52 or later, only for reopen --conflict | upgrade Pullboard on every linked device before using --conflict |
| LAND_HEADER | a displayed merge command fits the commit-header limit (accept result) | shorten the item title or cited rows so the merge header fits |
| ENGINE_VERSION | a verdict that implies items replays only under engine 20 or later (accept result) | upgrade Pullboard on every linked device before using --implies |
| LAND_HEADER | a displayed merge command fits the commit-header limit (reject result) | shorten the item title or cited rows so the merge header fits |
| ENGINE_VERSION | a verdict that implies items replays only under engine 20 or later (reject result) | upgrade Pullboard on every linked device before using --implies |
| NOT_YOURS | the automatic escalation is authorized as the coordinator or item holder (reject result) | ask the coordinator to inspect the item and its route |

For check diagnostics, a refusal from a failed or unverifiable check includes an output digest, sanitized tail, and a private full-output path in the CLI message (also `error.message` in JSON). The artifact is owner-readable only. If it cannot be saved, the tail remains available and the message names the storage error instead of claiming a path.
